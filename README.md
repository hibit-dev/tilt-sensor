# Tilt sensor
A tilt sensor is a type of sensor that can detect the orientation or tilt of an object relative to the force of gravity. It works by measuring the change in angle of the object with respect to the vertical axis.  

Tilt sensors can be found in various forms, such as simple mechanical switches, mercury switches, and electronic sensors. They are commonly used in applications that require the detection of tilting or changes in orientation, such as in construction equipment, automotive safety systems, robotics, and gaming controllers.  

In addition to detecting tilt, some advanced tilt sensors can also measure the magnitude of the tilt angle and the rate of change in angle, which makes them useful for monitoring and controlling complex systems.
